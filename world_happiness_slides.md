Began by creating a ‘Happiness Score’ heat map for each European country where the number within each country represents the overall score and the colours represent how high or how low the score is on a scale. Darker blue, the higher the score is, and the darker the red the lower the score is.
The next step is to identify the demographic and economic differences between the higher and lower countries to isolate the correlated features between them

Correlation coefficient is a measure of strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The closer that number is to 1, the more positively correlated they are. The closer to negative one that the number is, the more negatively correlated they are. Meaning, as one of the variables, such as happiness, goes up that the other variable like health would go down. And the closer to zero it is, it means they are not correlated at all.
Since we know longer life expectancy is related to happiness, what is it that creates a longer life expectancy?
